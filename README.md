#Bash Presentation
This is a bash presentation I did for the Ladies Who Code meetup on 07/18/15
the topic was "Enough bash to be dangerous"
I went over why bash can be very useful and how it is used today. 
My presentation was made with impress.js. The full slides can be
found in index.html, requires chrome or firefox. 
Scripts are included here too.
